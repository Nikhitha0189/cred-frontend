To host an expense tracker webpage on Vercel, start by developing the webpage using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript to create the necessary functionalities for tracking expenses. Once the webpage is ready, 
sign up for a Vercel account and initialize your project using the Vercel CLI. Deploy your project to 
Vercel by running the deployment command, and optionally configure a custom domain through the Vercel
dashboard if you have one. After deployment, thoroughly test the webpage to ensure all features work as 
expected and monitor its performance using Vercel's dashboard. Remember to continuously update and improve 
the webpage based on user feedback and changing requirements, deploying updates seamlessly through Vercel.
Additionally, prioritize security considerations, ensuring data encryption and compliance with any relevant 
financial regulations to protect users' sensitive information.
